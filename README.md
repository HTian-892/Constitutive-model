# Constitutive-model
This repository contains MATLAB functions for the calculations of Normal distribution parameters (Parameter.m) and microscopic strain of the skeleton portion of rocks (Strain.m). We provide the calculations of parameters and strain of the rock after the high temperature of 300 â„ƒ under the confining stress of 20 MPa as an example. All methods are explained in detail in the papers:
